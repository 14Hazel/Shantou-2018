# Algal Phylogenetics
#### Shantou University - Summer 2018

----

## Major Topics

### 1. [The UNIX environment & Basic R](https://github.com/chazgoo/Shantou-2018/tree/master/UNIX)
Bash: basic commands and navigation, directory structure, shell vs. kernel, pipes and scripts, regex. 

R: a programming language used for statistics and plotting data - we'll provide a basic intro.

#### [Day 2 bash stuff](https://github.com/chazgoo/Shantou-2018/tree/master/day_2_bash.md)

### 2. [The Data, QC, Assembly](https://github.com/chazgoo/Shantou-2018/tree/master/Assembly)
From raw sequence data to an assembled dataset: Trimming, QC, Assembly. 

### 3. [Identification: BLAST!](https://github.com/chazgoo/Shantou-2018/tree/master/Identification)
What genes are being transcribed? Why S. Altschull is the most cited biologist ever. Black-box vs. manual operation. Preparing a BLAST database and running the software.

### 4. [Annotation: HMMs, ORFs, & Quantification](https://github.com/chazgoo/Shantou-2018/tree/master/Annotation)
How do we identify open reading frames? How do we quantify expresison? Here we'll discuss how to start drawing biological inferences from our assembled data. 

### 5. [Phylogenetics](https://github.com/chazgoo/Shantou-2018/tree/master/Phylogenetics)
Species relationships vs. gene relationships: Orthologs, Paralogs, Xenologs.
