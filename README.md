# Algal Phylogenetics 
#### Shantou University - Summer 2018

----

### Major Topics

#### 1. The UNIX environment
What is UNIX? Basic commands and navigation, directory structure, command structures (optional, required), standard in/out/error, shell vs. kernel, pipes and scripts, regex

#### 2. The Data, Assembly
From raw sequence data to an assembled dataset, Trimming, QC, Assembly, Gap closure (lower stringency, against a scaffold, optical mapping?) 

#### 3. Basic annotation: HMMs, ORFs, Quantification
Genome vs Transcriptome, Intron vs Exon. How do we identify open reading frames? How do quantify expresison? 

#### 4. Identification: BLAST!
What genes are being transcribed? Why S. Altschull is the most cited biologist ever. Preparing a BLAST database and running the software. 

#### 5. Phylogenetic Trees
Species relationships vs. gene relationships: Orthologs, Paralogs, Xenologs.
