## Phylogenetic Analysis

Like the annotation section, I don't think we'll have time to really cover these topics, and so I'm going to leave these here in case you ever want to look into them. 

### [RAxML](https://raxml-ng.vital-it.ch/#/)

RAxML is a maximum-likelihood-based phylogeny builder.  

### [Mr. Bayes](http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/)

Mr. Bayes uses Bayesian inference to build trees instead. 

### [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/)

FigTree is a nice piece of software that allows for tree visualization.
