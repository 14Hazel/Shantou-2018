## Identification via BLAST

#### BLAST+
NCBI BLAST+ is available in the repositories from most Linux distributions and so can be installed in the same way as any other package. For example, on Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint:
- `sudo apt-get install ncbi-blast+`

Alternatively, instructions are provided for installing BLAST+ on Mac and various flavours of Linux on the "Standalone BLAST Setup for Unix" page of the BLAST+ Help manual [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1762/). Follow the instructions under "Configuration" in the BLAST+ help manual to add BLAST+ to the PATH environment variable.
