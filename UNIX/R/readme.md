## A crash-course in R

#### R is a statistical programming language used for many purposes. For data-exploration and plotting figures, it's nearly unparalleled. 

Today, we're going to download R and the associated IDE (Integrated Development Environment) called R Studio - with these, we'll work through a tutorial, and then get our first look at the data we'll be using for the remainder of the course. 

Once we finish this, you'll have enough of a background that we can properly begin our analysis!
