## The UNIX environment

In Bioinformatics, UNIX is the preferred operating environment: nearly all available software is written for UNIX.

### First things first: setting up! 

#### Mac and Linux systems, conventiently, are already UNIX-based - Windows, however, is not. This doesn't matter; for those of you running Windows, we'll need to configure your machines to run a virtual UNIX envrionment. 

If you have Windows 10, [this is easy.](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/)

Users with earlier versions of windows need to configure a [virtual machine.](https://blog.storagecraft.com/the-dead-simple-guide-to-installing-a-linux-virtual-machine-on-windows/)

#### Code editors: throughout all of this, you'll want a dedicated desktop program with which to write scripts, view files, and so on. Normal word processors (like Word) aren't ideal. 

- For Windows, [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) or [Atom](https://atom.io)
- For Mac, [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) or [Atom](https://atom.io)
- For Linux, [Atom](https://atom.io)

In addition to these, you'll want to get familiar with terminal-based text editing software. All of these are already built-in with Unix, so you don't need to download anything. They each have a steep learning curve, but can be incredibly powerful when you're comfortable using them. 

- [vim](https://www.vim.org)
- [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org) - probably the easiest to start with!
- [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

#### UNIX is best when used directly through your terminal. While in this class, one of our primary goals is to teach you to be comfortable working exclusively via the terminal. That said, it can sometimes be useful to have a graphical user interface available for file exploration, especially when working on a remote server. 

- For Windows, use [winSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)
- For Mac & Linux, use [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io)
